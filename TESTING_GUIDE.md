# Wikipoodia Extension - Testing Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start Testing

### 1. Load the Extension
1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select your `Wiki-Troll` project folder
5. The extension should load with the Wikipedia Troll icon in your toolbar

### 2. Basic Functionality Test
1. **Click the extension icon** ‚Üí Popup should open with toggle switch and humor mode selector
2. **Select a humor mode** ‚Üí Choose from Goofy, Outrageous, Obscene, Utter Misinfo, or Evil
3. **Toggle the prank ON** ‚Üí Status should show "On" in green
4. **Visit any Wikipedia article** (e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)
5. **Wait 1-3 seconds** ‚Üí AI-generated fake facts should appear seamlessly in the text (much faster than before!)
6. **Toggle the prank OFF** ‚Üí Page should automatically reload, removing all modifications

## üîç Detailed Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Wikipedia Page Detection
**What to test**: Extension only activates on Wikipedia pages
- ‚úÖ **Should work**: Any `*.wikipedia.org/wiki/[article]` page
- ‚ùå **Should NOT work**: 
  - Google.com
  - Wikipedia homepage (wikipedia.org)
  - Wikipedia special pages (wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:*)

### Test 2: Humor Mode Variations
**What to test**: Different humor modes produce appropriate content
1. Test each mode on the same Wikipedia page:
   - **üü¢ Goofy**: Family-friendly, silly scenarios
   - **üü° Outrageous**: PG-13 with innuendo, embarrassing situations
   - **üî¥ Obscene**: Adult humor with explicit content (NSFW)
   - **üîÑ Utter Misinfo**: Complete opposite facts (flipped dates, locations, etc.)
   - **üñ§ Evil**: Dark conspiracies and sinister undertones
2. Verify content matches the selected humor level
3. Check that mode selection persists across page reloads

### Test 3: Content Injection Quality  
**What to test**: Facts appear natural and believable
1. Visit different types of Wikipedia pages:
   - **Person**: Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, Leonardo da Vinci
   - **Place**: New York City, Mount Everest, Paris
   - **Concept**: Artificial Intelligence, Democracy, Physics
2. Check that facts are:
   - Written in Wikipedia style
   - Initially believable but ultimately absurd
   - Integrated seamlessly into existing paragraphs (no visual highlighting)
   - Placed systematically (every other qualifying paragraph, not random)
   - Only in paragraphs with 100+ characters

### Test 4: Systematic Selection Behavior
**What to test**: Paragraph selection follows new systematic approach
1. Visit a long Wikipedia article
2. Count paragraphs with fake facts
3. Should see facts in every other suitable paragraph (not random placement)
4. Maximum of 50 facts per page
5. Only paragraphs with 100+ characters should be selected

### Test 5: Popup Interface
**What to test**: User interface functionality
- Toggle switch changes color and position
- Humor mode selector works and persists
- Status text updates ("On" vs "Off")
- Status display background changes color
- Success messages appear briefly after toggle
- Extension remembers both prank state AND humor mode after browser restart

### Test 6: Performance & Caching
**What to test**: System efficiency (much improved!)
1. Visit the same Wikipedia page twice with prank enabled
2. Second visit should be lightning fast (cached facts, 100ms delays)
3. First visit should be faster than before (500ms delays for API calls)
4. Check browser console for cache performance stats
5. Multiple tabs should work independently without slowdown

## üõ† Debug & Troubleshooting

### Browser Console Commands
Open Developer Tools (F12) and try these in the console on a Wikipedia page:

```javascript
// Get current page statistics
WikipediaTrollDebug.getStats()

// View extracted page context
WikipediaTrollDebug.getContext()

// See which paragraphs were selected
WikipediaTrollDebug.getParagraphs()

// View all injected facts with cache info
WikipediaTrollDebug.getInjectedFacts()

// Highlight modified paragraphs with red borders
WikipediaTrollDebug.toggleDebugBorders()

// Highlight injected paragraphs (orange borders)
WikipediaTrollDebug.highlightInjected()

// Clear debug highlighting
WikipediaTrollDebug.clearHighlights()

// Reprocess the current page
WikipediaTrollDebug.reprocess()
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "Extension not loading"
- **Check**: PNG icon files exist in icons/ folder
- **Fix**: Ensure icon-16.png, icon-48.png, icon-128.png are present

#### Issue: "No facts appearing"
- **Check**: Console for error messages
- **Check**: OpenAI API key is set in background/background.js (line 24)
- **Check**: Prank is enabled AND humor mode is selected in popup
- **Check**: Page has paragraphs with 100+ characters

#### Issue: "API errors"
- **Check**: Network connection
- **Check**: OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
- **Check**: API key replaced placeholder text "Enter your OpenAI API key here"
- **Wait**: Extension has retry logic with exponential backoff

#### Issue: "Facts appearing too slowly"
- **Expected**: First visit ~3-5 seconds, cached visits ~1-2 seconds  
- **Check**: Cache is working (console shows "cached" vs "new API calls")
- **Note**: Much faster than previous versions due to optimizations

#### Issue: "Facts not matching humor mode"
- **Check**: Humor mode selection persisted correctly
- **Try**: Clear cache and regenerate facts
- **Note**: AI responses may vary - refresh page to regenerate

### Expected Console Output

```
