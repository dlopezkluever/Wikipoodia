# **Product Requirements Document: Wikipoodia Chrome Extension**

## **1\. Introduction**

The Wikipoodia Chrome Extension is a light-hearted browser extension designed to inject humorous, untrue, and often ridiculous "facts" into Wikipedia articles. Its primary purpose is to provide an entertaining and surprising experience for users, particularly when installed on a friend's computer as a harmless prank. The extension aims to generate confusion and laughter by seamlessly blending absurd information into the otherwise factual context of Wikipedia.

## **2\. Goals**

* **Core Goal:** To create a highly amusing and surprising experience for unsuspecting Wikipedia readers.  
* **Engagement:** To generate unique and contextually (but insanely absurdly) relevant fake facts using generative AI.  
* **Simplicity:** To provide a straightforward user interface for enabling and disabling the prank.  
* **Stealth (for prank purposes):** To operate subtly in the background once enabled, without constant user intervention.

## **3\. User Stories / Personas**

### **Persona: The Prankster (User installing the extension)**

* As a **Prankster**, I want to easily install the extension on my friend's browser so I can set up the joke quickly.  
* As a **Prankster**, I want a simple way to toggle the prank on or off so I can control when the joke is active.  
* As a **Prankster**, I want the fake facts to be genuinely funny and surprising so my friend gets a good laugh.  
* As a **Prankster**, I want the facts to seem somewhat plausible at first glance, but quickly reveal their absurdity, to maximize confusion before laughter.

### **Persona: The Unsuspecting Friend (Target of the prank)**

* As an **Unsuspecting Friend**, I want to browse Wikipedia as usual, unaware that the content is being altered.  
* As an **Unsuspecting Friend**, I want the injected facts to appear seamlessly integrated into the page's text so they are initially believable.  
* As an **Unsuspecting Friend**, I want to be utterly confused and then amused when I discover the ridiculous nature of the facts.

## **4\. Features**

### **4.1. Core Prank Functionality**

* **Content Injection:** The extension will identify paragraph elements (`<p>`) within Wikipedia articles.  
* **Targeted Modification:** A subset of identified paragraphs (e.g., \~30%) will be randomly selected for modification to avoid overwhelming the page.  
* **Seamless Integration:** Injected facts will be inserted into existing sentences or between sentences within paragraphs, maintaining a natural flow of text.

### **4.2. AI-Powered Fact Generation (OpenAI API Integration)**

* **Dynamic Fact Creation:** Instead of a static list, funny and untrue facts will be generated on-the-fly using the OpenAI API (`gpt-3.5-turbo` model).  
* **Contextual Relevance:** The AI will be prompted with the Wikipedia page's subject (e.g., the person's name from the page title) to generate facts that are absurdly relevant to that individual.  
* **Fact Caching:** To minimize API calls and improve performance, generated facts will be cached locally within the extension for the duration of the browsing session on that page, and potentially across a few pages.  
* **Error Handling:** The extension will gracefully handle cases where the OpenAI API call fails or returns an unexpected response, falling back to a default behavior (e.g., not injecting a fact, or logging an error).

### **4.3. User Interface (Popup)**

* **Toggle Switch:** A clear and intuitive toggle switch in the extension's popup (`popup.html`) will allow users to enable or disable the prank.  
* **Status Indicator:** The popup will display the current status of the prank ("Prank: On" or "Prank: Off").

### **4.4. State Persistence**

* **Setting Storage:** The enabled/disabled state of the prank will be saved using Chrome's `chrome.storage.sync` API, ensuring the setting persists across browser sessions.  
* **Initial Load:** When a Wikipedia page loads, the content script (`content.js`) will check the saved state and apply the prank if it's enabled.

## **5\. Technical Requirements / Considerations**

* **Chrome Extension Manifest V3:** The extension will adhere to Manifest V3 standards for security and performance.  
* **Web Technologies:** Built using standard web technologies: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS for styling), and JavaScript.  
* **Permissions:**  
  * `activeTab`: To get information about the currently active tab.  
  * `scripting`: To inject the `content.js` script into Wikipedia pages.  
  * `storage`: To save and retrieve the prank's enabled state.  
  * `host_permissions`: To allow the content script to interact with Wikipedia domains (`*://*.wikipedia.org/*`) and make API calls to the OpenAI API (`https://api.openai.com/*`).  
* **API Integration:**  
  * Direct client-side `fetch` requests from `content.js` to the OpenAI API.  
  * **API Key Management:** The OpenAI API key (`YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE`) will be securely embedded in the extension for development. For public distribution, a proxy server or user-provided key mechanism would be considered for enhanced security.  
* **Performance:**  
  * Asynchronous API calls to avoid blocking the main thread.  
  * Caching of AI-generated facts to reduce repeated API requests.  
  * Limited paragraph modification (e.g., 30%) to prevent performance degradation on heavily text-laden pages.  
* **Ethical Considerations:**  
  * **User Consent:** While designed as a prank, it's crucial to emphasize the ethical implications of installing software without explicit consent. The documentation and any distribution methods should encourage responsible use.  
  * **Content Moderation:** While the prompt for the AI aims for "funny" and "ridiculous," continuous monitoring of AI output is important to prevent the generation of genuinely offensive or harmful content. The current prompt is designed to steer clear of such issues.  
* **Reversion:** Disabling the prank will trigger a page reload to revert all injected content, ensuring a clean state.

## **6\. Future Enhancements (Potential)**

* **Customizable Prank Settings:** Allow users to define categories of fake facts (e.g., "historical," "scientific," "personal quirks").  
* **Targeted Pranks:** Enable users to specify certain Wikipedia pages or subjects for the prank.  
* **UI for API Key Input:** For standalone distribution, provide a secure way for users to input their own OpenAI API key.  
* **"Undo Last Prank" Button:** A button in the popup to revert the current page's changes without reloading the entire page (more complex, requiring DOM snapshotting).  
* **Sound Effects:** Play a subtle, humorous sound effect when a fake fact is encountered (requires careful implementation to not be annoying).

## **7\. Success Metrics**

* **User Feedback (Laughter Factor):** The primary measure of success will be anecdotal evidence of amusement and positive feedback from users and prank targets.  
* **Toggle Usage:** Tracking how often the prank is enabled/disabled (if analytics were implemented).  
* **API Call Success Rate:** Monitoring successful OpenAI API calls to ensure the fact generation is functioning reliably.
